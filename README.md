# Archive of my/my friends' Meower projects
Since Meower shut down on December 1st, 2024, I figured I would post everything me and my friends have made on Meower (that I can find, anyway) that isn't already available to the public, since I wanted to at least have our work be shown instead of entirely gone to waste.

Some of this code is slightly modified (in the case of, for example, Meowtch) to get it to work on the latest Meower server version.

Otherwise, this is raw material of stuff made for a social media that no longer exists. Enjoy <3

Sadly some of the files in the archive are too big to upload to the repo itself so you have to go to the Releases tab to download, sorry!

> [!WARNING]
> This code will likely not be maintained as Meower has shut down unless I host a Meower server and decide to continue any of these projects.
